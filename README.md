### 1.0.0
* First version committed

## Description
This module provides database access objects for different versions of bedework and different databases. 

The interfaces are database independent adn it is assumed the versions will change slower than for the implementing classes. Tools and systems using these may need to check the class of the interface to determine what capabilities are present.
